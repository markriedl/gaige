### Idle
###
### This is the default state of MyMinion. The main purpose of the Idle state is to figure out what state to change to and do that immediately.

class Idle(State):
	
	def enter(self, oldstate):
		State.enter(self, oldstate)
		# stop moving
		self.agent.stopMoving()

		return None

##############################
### Taunt
###
### This is a state given as an example of how to pass arbitrary parameters into a State.
### To taunt someome, Agent.changeState(Taunt, enemyagent)

class Taunt(State):

	def parseArgs(self, args):
		self.victim = args[0]

	def execute(self, delta = 0):
		if self.victim is not None:
